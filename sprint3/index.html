  <h1>CODE FATIGUE</h1>
  <h2>"Code Fatigue" is my attempt to visually express the exhaustion I experienced during this Colabor. 
    As someone who had never really coded before, I found myself spending countless hours in front of a screen, staring at lines of code that I didn’t really understand and by the end of each day, everything became one big blurry mess.
    Throughout the six-week Colabor, we completed three sprints and engaged with a wide range of artists, tools, and techniques. Two themes stuck with me: the pattern with squares (inspired by Vera Molnar, a pioneer in generative and computer art) and the concept of layers. Combining these, I developed two connected mini-projects that together form Code Fatigue.
    The first piece consists of layered codes. I printed out lines of code from various projects I worked on during the Colabor and clipped them into layered sheets. Viewed individually, each layer is just very long code. But when stacked together, a hidden message emerges — if you can make it out through the noise. The goal here is to strain the viewer’s eyes, much like my own were strained while trying to read code every day. It’s a way to replicate the visual fatigue that builds up through prolonged screen time.
    The second piece is what I call a visual exhaustion tracker. Using the AxiDraw, I created grid-based prints in which each square represents a single day of the Colabor — six rows for six weeks, seven columns for each day of the week, including weekends, since I often continued experimenting on my own time. The appearance of each square reflects my exhaustion on that day: the more chaotic or disrupted the square, the more exhausted I felt. Simpler, more uniform squares tend to mark the start of a sprint or self-study days, while messier ones align with deadlines.
    I produced several variations of these prints — some colorful, some minimal, some layered — to reflect the process of coding itself. Like the prints, the code rarely worked on the first try. There were always multiple paths, repeated attempts, and mixed outcomes. The trial-and-error, the messiness, is part of the process.

  <h3> To make the feeling of exhaustion even more relatable, I decided to add another layer by including different code snippets and elements from each day.
    This way, others can get more context and understand the story behind it more fully.</h3>

    <h3>Here I didn't have to use ChatGPT as my goal was to use my previous codes and work with that and not generate new codes. So I therefore didn't have to use ChatGPT other then asking questions about the AxiDraw mashine when things didn't run as smooth as I was hoping.</h3>
