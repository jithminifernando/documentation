  <h1>TAKE A BREAK | Browser extension</h1>
  <h2>For Sprint 2, the theme was “Take a break.” 
    In our group, we decided to make browser extensions that would interrupt the user after a while, to get them off the screen for a bit. Each of us created our own version of an extension based on that idea. It was a bit overwhelming at first, because even though I had made my own website for a module before with CSS and HTML and kind of forgot the majority of that module. But after a while I got the hang of it.
My first concept was to have the extension interrupt the user after around 20 minutes, and then block the website for 5 minutes, similar to a Pomodoro timer. At first, I thought the break could start when the user clicks on an i-dot (like the info icons on websites), and that dot would expand to cover the whole screen. But I realized that relying on someone clicking exactly on an i-dot wasn’t very likely, so I changed my idea.
Next, I thought it would be better if the user could just click anywhere, and from that click, a circle would grow. To make it a bit more meditative, like the others in the group were doing, I also made the circles transparent. That way, with every click, the screen would slowly get more and more covered, and eventually, a “time for a break” message would appear as if it was submerged under the layers. With that effect it kind of reminded me of rain drops, which I thought was fun.
Overall, I really enjoyed experimenting with different versions of this idea, especially with the colours and interactions. One thing that was (and still is) a bit challenging is getting the timer to work the way I want, but I’m slowly figuring it out. Also, coding together through live share was super helpful. That’s actually how I managed to get the “transparency and circle growth” extension to work, by building on some code that someone else in the group had already made.

 <h3>These are my first two sketches, both based on a breathing rhythm.
    The one on the left pauses for a few seconds at the top and bottom of the movement — simulating the act of "holding your breath" — before continuing.
    As I explored ideas for my browser extension, I modified this version slightly by adding a subtle growth to the circle during each pause, so that over time it gradually expands and eventually fills the entire canvas.</h3>

 <h3>Building on the previous two sketches, I developed this browser extension.
    It reacts to clicks near an "i-dot" by triggering an expansion that gradually fills the entire screen, temporarily blocking interaction with the page.
    However, after discussing the concept, I realized that the chances of a user clicking close to an i-dot were extremely low — meaning the extension would likely never activate. This insight led me to return to the sketches and rethink the idea entirely.</h3>

<h3>Since I still really liked the idea of a growing circle, I decided to let a dot expand from anywhere the user clicks, no longer relying on DOM elements. I also experimented with opacity — and really liked how the screen became increasingly opaque with each click, eventually filling in completely.
    To make it feel less plain, I tied this visual buildup to a hidden message that gradually becomes visible with each click. In the end, the screen is fully covered, revealing a message like “Time to take a break”, which then blocks access to the site for about five minutes.</h3>

 <h3>USE OF CHATPGT: During the second sprint, I surprisingly started out without relying on ChatGPT as much as I expected.
    I think this was because I was working directly on the p5.js website, where I had access to several tutorials that only needed minor modifications.
    Things got more challenging once I had to turn my sketch into a browser extension with interactive features — that’s when it got tricky.
    We were working with JavaScript, and at that point, I started asking ChatGPT for help more frequently.
    But just like before, I didn’t just copy the code — I asked for detailed explanations so I could understand what each part of the code was doing.
